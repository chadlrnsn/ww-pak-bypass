# WW Pak Bypass

A modern C++ implementation of [shorekeeper-patch](https://github.com/thexeondev/shorekeeper-patch) for OS_2.0.2, designed to bypass pak file verification.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- Windows SDK 10.0 and above
- C++17 or later

## Building from source

1. Clone the repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hellokittyfan48/ww-pak-bypass.git
```

2. Open the solution file `pak-bypass.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Compile in `Release | x64`
4. Inject & Start

## Find signature

Search for "Checking pak file "%s". This may take a while..." in a disassembler

Or find this using cheat engine `40 55 56 57 41 57 48 8d 6c 24 ? 48 81 ec ? ? ? ? 80 3d`

**Or make an actual signature:**
